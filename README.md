# Spreadsheet-to-Playlist
This program takes YouTube video links from a google spreadsheet and add it to a YouTube playlist.

This is a program that I did using google api for google sheets and youtube, the part that allows adding items to a youtube playlist is by youtube, I design the part where it takes and uses the info from the spreadsheet.

So far the project is still incomplete

For this project you need credentials from https://console.developers.google.com/ for the spreadsheets and for the youtube playlist.
